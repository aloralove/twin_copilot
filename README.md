# README: Twin Copilot Using a Bayesian Network

## Introduction
For my AI class, I developed the Twin Copilot project, aimed at enhancing user experience in digital twin applications, particularly in the Kartorium digital twin platform. The project's goal is to assist new users in navigating and building within the application using an AI-based approach.

## Problem
New users of digital twin technology may face challenges in effectively navigating and creating within virtual environments. This project seeks to address the need for an intuitive and user-friendly guidance system in digital twin interfaces.

## Solution
I developed the Twin Copilot, an AI system utilizing a Bayesian Network. The system was designed to analyze user behavior and preferences, offering customized guidance based on the accumulated data.

## Methodology
The project involved creating a Bayesian Network, trained on a simulated dataset representing varied user activities within the Kartorium platform. This model was designed to predict user actions and preferences, thereby enhancing the guidance offered.

## Key Features
- Simulation of user interactions across different scene types and features.
- Creation of a large dataset to reflect a wide range of user choices and behaviors.
- Use of a Bayesian Network to effectively model and predict user behavior.

## Results
The Bayesian Network demonstrated a high level of accuracy in predicting user preferences, significantly improving the intuitiveness and personalization of the user interface in the digital twin platform.

## Conclusion
The Twin Copilot project underscores the potential of AI in transforming user experiences with complex software platforms. Future enhancements could include integrating more advanced AI techniques for deeper user experience customization. Such as a Neural Network when there is more data available. This Bayesian Network can be accurate without a large amount of user data and is less computationally expensive.
